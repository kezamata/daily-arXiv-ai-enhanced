### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI系统的递归自我改进，提出了可测试的失控增长条件，并提供了实际可实施的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在什么可测量条件下AI能力会在有限时间内无限增长，以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可测试条件取代猜测。

Method: 开发递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，基于物理和信息理论限制定义服务边界，建立内生增长模型。

Result: 推导出将可观测序列映射为失控与非奇异行为证书的决策规则，提供基于功率上限、吞吐量限制和评估门控等实际可实施的安全控制。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试条件和可部署控制取代了对AI奇点的猜测，为认证或排除AI奇点提供了理论基础和实践工具。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的数据归属方法计算资源消耗大，难以在实际应用中部署，需要开发更高效的归属方法。

Method: 将基于遗忘的慢速归属方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索方法，避免运行昂贵的归属算法。

Result: 在MSCOCO和LAION数据集上的实验表明，该方法在几秒内达到更好或竞争性性能，比现有方法快2500-400000倍。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上大规模应用数据归属方法迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发并验证了首个基于共识的视频评估工具ColoWorkflow，用于微创结直肠手术的工作流程分析，建立了可重复的评估框架，支持跨机构基准测试和AI驱动的流程识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在程序变异性大、学习曲线陡峭和并发症影响质量的问题，现有工作流程分析工具难以标准化和实施，需要开发数据驱动的视频评估工具来减少变异性、优化培训。

Method: 通过德尔菲法达成工作流程描述符共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并由独立评估者在多中心视频数据集（腹腔镜和机器人结直肠手术）上应用该工具，评估适用性和评估者间可靠性。

Result: 达成了10个程序无关阶段和34个程序特定步骤的共识，工具在54个手术视频中表现出广泛适用性，评估者间可靠性中等（阶段K=0.71，步骤K=0.66），主要差异出现在阶段转换和步骤边界定义。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow是首个基于共识的验证视频评估工具，为微创结直肠手术建立了可重复的工作流程分析框架，可标准化培训、加速能力获取并推动数据驱动的手术质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LRP的剪枝方法虽然不需要微调，适合数据有限场景，但仍存在显著的精度下降问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用可解释AI技术Layer-wise Relevance Propagation(LRP)进行模型剪枝，在少量数据条件下进行剪枝操作。

Result: 该方法实现了比现有方法更高的剪枝率，同时更好地保持了模型精度。

Conclusion: 提出的LRP剪枝方法在数据有限场景下具有更好的实用价值，能够有效平衡剪枝率和精度保持。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Short-Window Sliding Learning framework for real-time violence detection in CCTV footages. Unlike conventional long-video training approaches, the proposed method divides videos into 1-2 second clips and applies Large Language Model (LLM)-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets. Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events.

Abstract: This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting. A video projector (V-JEPA Vision Transformer) associated to a lightweight probabilistic head is attached to a pre-trained satellite vision encoder (DINOv3\text{-}SAT493M) to map encoder tokens into a discrete empirical CDF (eCDF) over 4-hour accumulated rainfall.

As an alternative, 3D-UNET baselines trained with an aggregate Rank Probability Score and a per-pixel Gamma-Hurdle objective are used. On the Weather4Cast 2025 benchmark, the proposed method achieved a promising performance, with a CRPS of 3.5102 (CRPS), which represents $\approx$26\% in effectiveness gain against the best 3D-UNET.

### [7] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin是一种新颖的相位窗口搜索算法，用于对象级基础模型的忠实区域归因，通过分阶段粗到细搜索实现近线性复杂度，在保持高忠实度的同时大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于子模子集选择的归因方法虽然忠实度高，但计算效率低，限制了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪婪选择。

Result: PhaseWin仅使用20%的计算预算就能达到贪婪归因95%以上的忠实度，在物体检测和视觉定位任务中持续优于其他归因基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为对象级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [8] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测器性能，在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K基准测试中超越了现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的OOD检测方法使用负提示来强调图像特征与提示内容之间的差异，但这些提示通常包含广泛的非ID特征，可能捕获重叠或误导性信息，导致次优结果。

Method: 提出正负提示监督方法：1) 使用大型语言模型初始化类别特定的正负提示；2) 优化提示，使正提示聚焦于类别内特征，负提示突出类别边界特征；3) 采用基于图的结构聚合语义感知监督，并将其传播到视觉分支。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K两个基准测试上，针对八个OOD数据集和五种不同LLM的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过优化正负提示来捕获类别间特征，并将语义知识转移到视觉模态，可以有效提升OOD检测性能，该方法在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n两种轻量级模型在面部表情识别任务中的性能，发现在干净数据集上YOLOv12n表现更优，而在噪声数据上YOLOv11n具有更高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无约束真实环境中进行面部表情识别仍然具有挑战性，需要平衡性能和效率的轻量级模型。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型在统一检测和分类框架下进行评估。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净的KDEF数据集上获得95.6的mAP 0.5最高性能，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精度达到65.2，假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡性能与效率，在敏感性和精度之间存在权衡，适合实时资源受限的情感感知AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [10] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的新框架，用于解决异构架构（如ViT到ResNet18）知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合教师和学生的互补特征，在共享logits中对齐表示，并引入子logit解耦蒸馏和正交性损失来确保知识多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统同构KD方法难以有效解决。现有异构KD方法存在计算成本高、设计复杂或过度依赖logit对齐等问题，限制了互补特征的利用。

Method: HCD框架通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征，与教师倒数第二层特征拼接，通过互补特征映射器（CFM）生成共享logits。引入子logit解耦蒸馏（SDD）将共享logits划分为n个子logits，与教师logits融合修正分类。使用正交性损失（OL）确保子logit多样性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的KD方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，成为异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中医疗图像特征异质性的挑战，现有方法存在上下文表示学习不完整和层间风格偏差累积两个关键限制。

Method: 提出FedBCS方法：1）频域自适应风格重校准构建原型，解耦内容-风格表示并学习最优风格参数；2）上下文感知双级原型对齐，从编码器和解码器不同层提取领域不变原型并与上下文信息融合。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提高了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

*Ren Zhang,Huilai Li,Chao qi,Guoliang Xu,Tianyu Zhou,Wei wei,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DEFT-LLM方法，通过多专家解耦实现运动语义对齐，解决微表情识别中静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动语义差距的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别对于推断真实情感至关重要。现有方法存在两个核心挑战：(1)静态外观和动态运动线索的纠缠阻碍模型关注细微运动；(2)现有数据集中的文本标签与面部肌肉运动不完全对应，造成文本监督与物理运动之间的语义差距。

Method: 提出DEFT-LLM方法，首先构建Uni-MER运动驱动指令数据集，利用光流和动作单元标签的双重约束确保时空一致性和运动对应关系。然后设计包含三个专家的架构，将面部动态解耦为独立可解释的表征（结构、动态纹理和运动语义）。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的微表情识别基准测试中展示了最先进的性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模方面具有特殊优势。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM方法通过整合Uni-MER的指令对齐知识，为微表情注入有效的物理先验，同时利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，能够精确捕捉细微情感线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

TL;DR: ERMoE是一种稀疏MoE架构，通过将专家重新参数化为正交特征基，并用特征基得分（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替代学习门控逻辑，解决了路由不稳定和专家利用率不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE架构中路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不匹配导致的路由不稳定、专家利用率不足，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题。标准解决方案（如辅助负载均衡损失）会削弱专家专业化并影响下游性能。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化为学习的正交特征基，用特征基得分（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替换学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由，将token分配直接与专家表示空间关联。

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准（如COCO、Flickr30K）上达到最先进精度，自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布。3D MRI变体（ERMoE-ba）将脑年龄预测精度提高7%以上，并产生解剖学上可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE引入了一种新的稀疏专家模型架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定性问题，在保持稀疏性的同时实现可扩展、可解释的专业化，提高了性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

### [14] [Preserving Cross-Modal Consistency for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10974)
*Haoran Chen,Houze Xu,Micah Goldblum,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DMC和DMC-OT两个框架，用于解决CLIP模型在类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题，通过解耦视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化来保持跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP模型在持续学习新类别时存在严重分类器偏差，文本原型容易过拟合到新类别，且生成式重放方法忽视了视觉编码器更新带来的分布漂移问题。

Method: DMC采用两阶段框架：解耦视觉编码器适应和文本软提示优化，每个阶段训练时冻结另一模态；DMC-OT在此基础上加入最优传输引导的校准策略来对齐内存统计量，并采用任务特定提示设计增强任务间可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都达到了最先进的性能，DMC-OT进一步将准确率平均提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: 通过解耦模态优化和最优传输校准，DMC框架有效解决了CLIP在类增量学习中的分类器偏差和分布漂移问题，显著提升了持续学习性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

### [15] [PAS: A Training-Free Stabilizer for Temporal Encoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10979)
*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过多相位聚合平滑时间核，解决视频LLMs中的时间不一致性问题，无需训练即可提升模型对时间偏移的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会导致注意力翻转并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于多模态RoPE扩展导致的逆傅里叶时间核中的帧尺度波纹。

Method: 提出PAS方法：在多个注意力头中应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。该方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并降低相位敏感性，不改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在相同token预算下显示出持续改进，计算开销可忽略不计。PAS为视频LLMs提供了即插即用的鲁棒时间编码升级方案。

Conclusion: PAS通过平滑RoPE旋转对数的时间核，实现了对小时间偏移的注意力Lipschitz稳定性，多相位平均在保持每个头频谱的同时衰减了高频波纹。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

### [16] [Binary Verification for Zero-Shot Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10983)
*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，用于零样本视觉任务。该方法通过量化和二值化两个步骤，将开放式查询转换为多项选择题，再进一步转化为真/假验证问题，显著提升了零样本视觉任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中直接回答开放式查询时性能有限，需要一种无需额外训练就能提升准确性的推理时方法。

Method: 包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放式查询转换为具有明确候选答案的多项选择题；(2) 二值化：为每个候选答案提出真/假问题，通过确定性规则进行选择。

Result: 在指代表达式定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，该方法相比直接回答开放式查询获得了显著提升，量化到多项选择题带来大幅增益，真/假二值化提供了一致的额外提升。

Conclusion: 该工作流提供了一个简单统一的推理时设计方法，无需任务特定训练，为当前视觉语言模型提供了实用的零样本视觉能力增强路径。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

*Keunwoo Park,Jihye Chae,Joong Ho Ahn,Jihoon Kweon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的生成模型框架，通过在U-Net架构中添加第二注意力层和样式编码器，实现了无需额外数据的可控图像生成，在医学领域小数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域（如医学）中数据种类有限、数量不足时，现有文本到图像生成方法难以实现多样性和稳定性平衡的问题。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入样式编码器处理图像和提示生成样式嵌入，在U-Net中添加第二注意力层，通过KL散度实现潜在空间的连续高斯表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%；仅使用合成数据训练分类器在1000%规模下F1分数达83.21%，结合真实数据可达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示注意分层对比学习来解决模态缺失问题，提升跨模态表示的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态数据常常存在模态缺失情况，现有方法通过简单生成方式处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出PROMISE框架，将多模态提示学习融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门设计的提示注意机制，动态生成鲁棒且一致的表示来处理缺失模态场景。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和消融研究表明，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过创新的提示注意分层对比学习机制，有效弥合完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，为模态缺失场景提供了鲁棒的跨模态表示解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

*Zongyang Qiu,Bingyuan Wang,Xingbei Chen,Yingqing He,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个专为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画贴纸，每段视频都有情感标签、视觉属性和文本描述。基于该数据集开发了情感条件视频生成技术，显著提升了文本到视频和图像到视频生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实情境下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，通过系统分析揭示视觉特征与情感感知的空间和时间模式，并基于这些洞察开发了通过微调Wan2.1模型的情感条件视频生成技术。

Result: 结果显示在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量都有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频中的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型过度依赖语言先验而非视觉证据，导致产生不准确或幻觉化的响应，缺乏对模型实际使用视觉信息程度的量化衡量。

Method: DnR框架包含问题条件化相关性映射来定位问题特定线索，通过相关性引导的概率掩码测量依赖度，并利用外部视觉专家输出作为视觉线索进行迭代精炼。

Result: 在VQA和图像描述基准测试中实现了准确率的一致提升，显著减少了幻觉生成。

Conclusion: 测量视觉利用率为构建更可解释和证据驱动的多模态智能体系统提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在"视觉处理瓶颈"，容易失去对视觉证据的把握，在长序列生成中缺乏情境化视觉体验。

Method: 受人类认知记忆理论启发，VisMem为VLMs配备动态潜在视觉记忆：短时模块用于细粒度感知保留，长时模块用于抽象语义整合，在推理过程中无缝调用这些记忆。

Result: 在多样化的视觉理解、推理和生成基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem建立了一种新的潜在空间记忆增强范式，能够同时保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种针对扩散式文本到图像模型的推理时引导方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，只在图像的不安全区域进行引导，实现更安全的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度，也无法仅针对图像的不安全区域进行引导，这限制了安全生成的效果。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词危害性，并应用选择性引导掩码，只对图像中的不安全区域进行引导，而不是全局调整。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最大限度地减少对内容的意外改变。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中存在信息丢失问题，限制了高频细节的恢复能力。

Method: 利用小波的完美重建特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，构建即插即用的解码器块，消除U-Net变体的内在重建瓶颈。

Result: 在CrackVision12K数据集上显著提升细裂纹（宽度小于4像素）分割性能；在SIDD智能手机图像去噪中PSNR获得适度提升；验证了跨高低频域的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，在统一的重建感知框架内实现高频保真度和全局一致性，同时保持可比较的计算成本。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估基准的空白，揭示了MLLMs在复杂协作场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法未能利用胚胎发育的先验分布来提高准确性，且依赖单焦点信息导致胚胎表示不完整，容易在细胞遮挡下产生特征模糊。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：首先训练冻结的帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；然后通过多焦点特征融合策略构建3D感知形态表示，并设计混合语义-边界条件块将语义和边界线索注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上分别达到82.8%和81.3%的准确率，仅需单次去噪步骤即可获得最佳平均测试性能。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过融合多焦点信息和利用扩散模型，有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，实现了高精度的胚胎发育阶段分类。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合粒度缓存（HGC）方法，通过在可控生成模型的不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来减少计算开销，显著提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时计算需求高，导致生成效率普遍较低。

Method: 采用两种缓存策略：1）基于特征重用的粗粒度缓存（块级），在模型推理的每一步中动态绕过编码器-解码器块中的冗余计算；2）细粒度缓存（提示级），在模块内重用连续推理步骤中的交叉注意力图，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本（MACs）显著降低63%（从18.22T降至6.70T），同时语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法在平衡生成效率和视觉质量方面具有优势，能够有效减少可控生成模型的计算开销。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Motivation: 现有医学多模态大模型在未见过的成像模态、解剖结构和任务类型组合上的泛化能力尚未充分探索，需要专门的基准来评估其组合泛化能力。

Method: 将CheXpert、SIIM-ACR、BraTS 2020和MosMedData四个数据集重新格式化为统一的VQA格式，使用MAT框架构建训练和测试分割，评估LLaVA-Vicuna-7B和Qwen2-VL-7B模型在相关、不相关和零重叠设置下的性能。

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务迁移显示仅使用分类数据训练也能提升分割性能7% cIoU。多模态LLM在组合泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CrossMed为评估医学视觉语言模型的零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台，多模态LLM在组合泛化方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

TL;DR: PINGS-X是一个基于轴对齐时空高斯表示的新型框架，用于4D流MRI的超分辨率重建，显著减少训练时间同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D流MRI需要高时空分辨率来早期检测心血管疾病，但高分辨率导致扫描时间过长。现有基于PINNs的方法虽然有效，但需要为每个患者单独训练，训练过程过于缓慢。

Method: 提出PINGS-X框架，采用轴对齐时空高斯表示来建模高分辨率血流速度。关键创新包括：归一化高斯溅射（具有形式收敛保证）、轴对齐高斯（简化高维数据训练）、高斯合并程序（防止退化解并提升计算效率）。

Result: 在计算流体动力学和真实4D流MRI数据集上的实验表明，PINGS-X显著减少了训练时间，同时实现了优越的超分辨率精度。

Conclusion: PINGS-X通过创新的高斯表示方法，有效解决了4D流MRI超分辨率重建中的训练效率问题，为临床实践提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

Conclusion: 通过多参考图像和特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地同时实现细节保持和前景姿态/视角调整。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器加速方法面临动态稀疏注意力模式计算开销大、估计误差高，而静态稀疏模式固定且次优的权衡问题。

Method: 识别扩散注意力稀疏模式在去噪步骤间具有强时序一致性的特性，引入LiteAttention方法，利用时序一致性在去噪序列中实现进化计算跳过，早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生成视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且无质量损失。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的自适应性和静态方法的效率，为扩散变换器提供了一种有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种有前景的生成模型——去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器，在生成形状建模和补全任务中的表现，发现扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在相同离散潜在空间中可以匹配或超越扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成模型在包括3D数据在内的多种数据模态中得到了广泛应用，但对于哪种模型最适合特定任务尚未达成共识。此外，文本和图像等条件信息经常被用于引导生成过程，而其他条件信息（如部分3D数据）尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 将去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器这两种最有前景的生成模型适配到生成形状建模和补全任务中，进行了全面的定量评估和比较，包括基线判别模型和广泛的消融研究。

Result: 结果表明：(1) 具有连续潜在空间的扩散模型在从单个噪声深度图像进行多模态形状补全的任务中，优于判别模型和自回归方法，并在现实条件下实现了最先进的性能；(2) 在相同的离散潜在空间中比较时，自回归模型可以匹配或超越扩散模型在这些任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在离散潜在空间中具有竞争力，为不同条件下的3D生成任务提供了有价值的模型选择指导。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Conclusion: SaTformer通过创新的视频变换器架构和数据处理技术，成功解决了极端降水预测问题，为AI天气预测提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Motivation: 解决现有KBVQA方法推理过程不明确的问题，无论是基于上下文学习的隐式知识还是基于检索增强生成的显式知识，都缺乏MLLMs的显式多步推理轨迹。

Method: 1) 利用冻结的7B规模MLLM构建后见零训练数据；2) 自蒸馏为思维链生成器和知识生成器；3) 使用KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好低置信度但有用的知识；4) 利用生成的思维链和采样知识进行答案预测。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，通过后见蒸馏和知识鼓励偏好优化，在KBVQA任务中实现了高效的知识推理，为MLLMs的内部知识利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混响变换的轨迹预测模型Rev，通过显式学习和预测智能体对轨迹变化事件的延迟响应，模拟不同智能体的延迟偏好和随机性，实现可控的轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹预测任务的核心是连接智能体的时空关系，但现有方法难以显式学习和预测智能体对轨迹变化事件的延迟响应（latencies），这可能导致预测系统缺乏因果连续性并产生不合理的轨迹。

Method: 受声学中混响曲线的启发，提出混响变换和相应的Rev轨迹预测模型，使用两个显式可学习的混响核来模拟和预测每个智能体的不同延迟偏好及其随机性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Rev在保持竞争力的预测精度的同时，能够揭示跨智能体和场景的可解释延迟动态。

Conclusion: 定性分析验证了所提混响变换的特性，突显其作为通用延迟建模方法的潜力。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用于可解释的多类型异常检测，能够区分不同类型的异常，同时减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练单独模型，计算成本高。大型视觉语言模型虽然能解决此问题，但计算密集，不适合实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 提出MultiTypeFCDD框架，仅使用图像级标签学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型。作为统一框架，可跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上评估，结果与最先进复杂模型相当，但参数负载和推理时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法是计算资源受限现实应用中的实用可行解决方案。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4DGS方法假设输入视频流时序同步，这限制了其在异步数据上的重建质量。

Method: 采用粗到精的对齐模块，首先确定粗略的帧级偏移，然后细化到亚帧精度，该策略可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序错位视频，并显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的时序对齐策略增强了4DGS框架在处理异步多视角视频时的鲁棒性，实现了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过状态空间方法和视觉定位增强，在保持高效推理的同时解决了多模态模型在细粒度理解方面的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义的小输入变化下的可靠性仍未被充分理解，需要系统评估模型对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过像素级偏移、轻微几何变换、填充重缩放、转述和多语言重写等语义保持的视觉和文本扰动，在广泛的模型和数据集上测试VLM的稳定性。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，大量样本在至少一种视觉或文本修改下改变预测答案。样本级稳定性是正确性的强指标，稳定样本更可能被正确回答。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 配备模块化组件的基础模型不受初始训练范围限制，可以发展为医学成像的多任务、多模态系统。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在稀疏训练视图下容易过拟合，主要原因是缺乏中间视角的监督。受视频扩散模型(VDM)成功的启发，作者希望从预训练的VDM中提取丰富的多视角一致性先验知识。

Conclusion: GSD框架通过利用VDM的多视角一致性先验，有效解决了3DGS在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，并通过深度和语义引导确保了正确的相机姿态和几何精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

TL;DR: DiT-Gaze是一个基于扩散变换器和3D高斯溅射的高保真视线重定向框架，通过弱监督和正交约束损失实现更准确的视线合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射模型在渲染细微连续视线变化时存在困难，需要更高保真度的视线重定向方法来生成增强数据以提升视线估计器的泛化能力。

Method: 结合扩散变换器(DiT)进行高保真图像合成，使用合成生成的中间视线角度进行弱监督训练，并引入正交约束损失来解耦视线、头部姿态和表情的内部表示。

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze为创建合成训练数据提供了优越的方法，代码和模型将向研究社区开放用于基准测试。

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够自适应建模不同领域分布，同时保持跨领域几何和结构先验。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 提出的MoE LoRA框架能够有效解决少样本风格编辑问题，在参数效率和性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在理解真实世界3D空间智能方面存在根本性困难，主要源于输入阶段几何感知编码器与2D特征的冲突，以及输出阶段离散分词器无法产生精确连续数值的双重瓶颈。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据与2D视觉特征；直接回归头（DRH）采用"嵌入即值"范式，通过轻量级MLP实现精确连续回归。

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦3D推理和数值生成的双模块设计，有效解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解方面的双重瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: 通过标记分组方法可以显著提高视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，发现的标记组能够有效对应文本中的可接地信息。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态来改进文本到图像生成中的对象计数准确性，提高约4%的计数准确率而不影响视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法准确遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言与视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现这些模型并非完全对数字不敏感，它们隐式地知道自己的计数准确性。

Method: 基于模型内部已编码数值正确性的潜在认知，提出CountSteer方法，在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验显示CountSteer将对象计数准确率提高了约4%，同时保持了视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer展示了通过利用模型内部信号来实现更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成的简单而有效的步骤。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

TL;DR: DocSLM是一种高效的小型视觉语言模型，专为资源受限的边缘设备上的长文档理解而设计，通过分层多模态压缩器和流式弃权机制，在减少视觉标记、参数和延迟的同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在长文档理解方面表现出色，但内存占用高，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。

Method: 采用分层多模态压缩器联合编码每页的视觉、文本和布局信息为固定长度序列，并引入基于熵不确定度校准的流式弃权机制进行顺序处理。

Result: 在多个长多模态文档基准测试中，DocSLM匹配或超越最先进方法，同时减少82%视觉标记、75%参数和71%延迟。

Conclusion: DocSLM能够在轻量级边缘设备上提供可靠的多模态文档理解，实现高效的长文档处理。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD是一个用于6DoF物体姿态估计的标准分辨率事件相机合成数据集，包含50,000个事件序列，采用物理渲染和线性相机运动模拟生成，提供了优化的时间表面表示和极性编码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机视觉领域缺乏与帧式计算机视觉相当的全面合成数据资源的问题，为6DoF物体姿态估计研究提供标准化的数据集。

Method: 基于物理渲染场景和BOP方法学，使用模拟线性相机运动生成34ms持续时间的事件序列，系统评估了CNN推理的事件表示方法，包括时间表面线性衰减和双通道极性编码。

Result: 线性衰减时间表面和双通道极性编码在姿态估计性能上表现最优，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案，极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: YCB-Ev SD数据集填补了事件相机视觉合成数据的空白，提供了结构化格式的原始事件流和预计算最优表示，支持即时研究和可重复基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D是一个无需3D运动标注的3D人体运动生成框架，通过2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并使用3D无监督正则化目标实现鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这源于精确3D监督导致模型过度拟合固定坐标模式而非学习核心3D结构和运动语义。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ)将2D运动序列映射到3D一致潜在空间，并采用视图一致性、方向连贯性和物理合理性等3D无监督正则化目标。

Result: 仅使用2D运动数据训练，Free3D能生成多样化、时序连贯且语义对齐的3D运动，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展且数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: 本文提出LSEF框架，通过低秩稀疏原理分层解耦情感动态，包含稳定性编码、动态解耦和一致性集成三个模块，显著提升了视频情感计算的鲁棒性和动态辨别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临模型不稳定和表征退化问题，核心限制在于缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基和瞬时波动）。

Method: 提出基于低秩稀疏原则的LSEF框架，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性集成模块重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，并采用秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态辨别能力。

Conclusion: 分层低秩稀疏建模对于理解情感动态具有有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Conclusion: 精心构建的数据集能够使小型MLLM在显微镜推理任务上达到与大型模型竞争的性能，证明了高质量数据构建的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要建立系统评估框架来填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架Q-Doc：粗粒度级别让MLLMs为文档图像分配质量分数；中粒度级别设计失真类型识别任务；细粒度级别引入失真严重程度评估。

Result: 评估表明MLLMs具有初步DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判等关键限制，思维链提示能显著提升所有级别的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准测试，揭示了其在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了改进的有希望途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个新颖的类增量学习框架，通过在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行正交低秩融合，实现无额外参数的高效增量学习，有效防止遗忘并提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP在类增量学习中的两个主要挑战：(1) 适应下游任务需要额外可学习模块，增加模型复杂度和遗忘风险；(2) 现有方法未能充分利用多模态表示的优势来有效整合视觉和文本模态。

Method: 提出BOFA框架，将所有模型适应限制在CLIP现有的跨模态桥接层，采用正交低秩融合机制将参数更新约束到与过去任务特征正交的低秩安全子空间，并使用跨模态混合原型结合稳定的文本原型和视觉对应物。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，BOFA在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BOFA通过限制在CLIP桥接层的正交低秩适应，实现了无需数据回放的稳定知识积累，为类增量学习提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊性，特别是多模态标志性现象，即图像和文本唤起文化共享关联的情况。现有研究主要关注遗忘，而本文关注模型记住什么以及如何记住，聚焦于识别文化引用与复制它们之间的平衡。

Method: 1. 引入评估框架，区分识别（模型是否识别引用）和实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释来描绘）；2. 评估五个扩散模型在767个Wikidata来源的文化引用上的表现；3. 进行提示扰动实验，使用同义词替换和字面图像描述；4. 分析文化对齐与训练数据频率、文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期的相关性。

Result: 1. 提出的框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换；2. 即使文本提示被改变，模型仍经常复制标志性视觉结构；3. 文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、引用流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于它们复制什么，还在于它们如何转换和重新语境化文化知识。这项工作将评估从简单的文本-图像匹配推进到更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个受大脑启发的条件扩散框架，通过将fMRI信号按视觉皮层层次结构分组并转换为多尺度皮层金字塔，在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示，实现高效且可解释的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器大多直接基于fMRI特征，忽略了大脑的层次处理结构，模糊了早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的不同作用。

Method: 使用ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，通过轻量级深度匹配ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集(NSD)上，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 按皮层层次结构组织条件化是纯数据驱动嵌入的强大替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用的视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对MLLM模型理解视觉提示能力的系统评估，而视觉提示是人类直观的图像交互方式，需要明确当前模型是否能有效识别和使用视觉提示。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段测试模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示，涵盖8种形状和355种属性组合；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响，测量其在真实问题解决场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究MLLM如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的参考问题建立了新的参考框架，填补了现有基准测试的空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Conclusion: VoxTell展示了视觉语言模型在医学图像分割中的有效性，为临床医生提供了使用自然语言进行精确3D图像分析的新工具。

Abstract: We introduce VoxTell, a vision-language model for text-prompted volumetric medical image segmentation. It maps free-form descriptions, from single words to full clinical sentences, to 3D masks. Trained on 62K+ CT, MRI, and PET volumes spanning over 1K anatomical and pathological classes, VoxTell uses multi-stage vision-language fusion across decoder layers to align textual and visual features at multiple scales. It achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across modalities on unseen datasets, excelling on familiar concepts while generalizing to related unseen classes. Extensive experiments further demonstrate strong cross-modality transfer, robustness to linguistic variations and clinical language, as well as accurate instance-specific segmentation from real-world text.

*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MaMOL的框架，用于处理遥感多模态分类中的模态缺失问题，通过双路由机制实现参数高效的自适应，在多个基准测试中表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致的模态缺失问题，现有两阶段自适应方法计算成本高且假设训练时具有完整多模态数据，限制了其在现实世界不完整性中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出缺失感知的LoRA混合框架，将模态缺失重新表述为多任务学习问题，引入双路由机制：任务导向的动态路由器和模态特定共享的静态路由器，通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效自适应。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中，在不同缺失率下表现出优越的鲁棒性和泛化能力，计算开销最小。在自然图像数据集上的迁移实验验证了其可扩展性和跨领域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL是不完整多模态学习的一种通用且高效的解决方案，具有优越的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Roman Kinakh,Gonzalo R. Ríos-Muñoz,Arrate Muñoz-Barrutia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nnUNet-B是一个贝叶斯分割框架，通过多模态后验采样直接从H&E染色组织学图像推断PD-L1表达，提供准确分割和认知不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于免疫组织化学的PD-L1表达评估方法资源密集，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2构建贝叶斯分割框架，在循环训练期间采样多样化模型检查点来近似后验分布，通过熵和标准差进行不确定性估计。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，平均Dice分数为0.805，平均IoU为0.709，性能与现有基线方法相当，同时提供像素级不确定性图谱。

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)方法，利用注意力权重检测大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题，无需额外训练即可实时过滤幻觉预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，研究发现许多幻觉预测中模型会忽略图像而依赖先前生成的标记来推断新物体。

Method: 通过计算图像与预测物体在给定先前标记条件下的互信息，发现弱图像依赖与幻觉强相关。基于此提出PAS信号，从对先前标记的注意力权重中计算得出。

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的物体幻觉检测性能，支持实时过滤和干预。

Conclusion: PAS是一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，能有效检测和缓解大型视觉语言模型的物体幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

### [85] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加少量双向注意力层来对齐视觉和文本的隐藏状态，在保持编码器效率的同时提升多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型要么在编码器早期融合特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，但两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含了丰富的模态特定结构信息，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的多模态匹配方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部放置少量仅跨模态的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态投影到共享空间进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新和稳定器来改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于同类视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种高效的多模态融合方法，通过轻量级的跨模态对齐模块，在不牺牲编码器理解能力的情况下显著提升多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

*Felix George,Harshit Kumar,Divya Pathak,Kaustabha Ray,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构和语义分析的无人监督循环检测框架，用于检测LLM驱动的智能应用中隐藏的执行循环，显著优于单一方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的智能应用存在非确定性行为，可能形成隐藏的执行循环，默默消耗资源而不触发显式错误，传统可观测性平台无法检测这些成本高昂的低效问题。

Method: 采用混合方法：首先应用计算高效的时间调用栈分析识别显式循环，然后利用语义相似性分析发现以冗余内容生成为特征的微妙循环。

Result: 在基于LangGraph的股票市场应用的1575条轨迹上评估，混合方法F1得分为0.72（精确率：0.62，召回率：0.86），显著优于单一结构方法（F1：0.08）和语义方法（F1：0.28）。

Conclusion: 虽然结果令人鼓舞，但仍有很大改进空间，未来工作需要完善方法并解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的多轮交互方法，用于自动生成高质量、结构化的军事模拟推演分析报告，通过任务分解、自定义工具和模板设计提升分析效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工分析军事模拟推演数据耗时且易出错，而单一指令输入大语言模型无法获得结构化的高质量分析报告，需要更有效的方法来提升分析效率和准确性。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为子任务，为每个子任务设计系统提示和用户提示，通过多轮交互结合自检和反思机制进行结构化数据提取和多步分析评估，定义自定义工具生成图表和计算指标，并设计多种报告模板以适应不同场景。

Result: 广泛的评估结果表明，该方法生成的报告质量更高，相比基线方法获得了更高的评分。

Conclusion: 提出的多轮交互方法能够有效生成高质量的结构化军事模拟推演分析报告，显著提升了分析效率和准确性。

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过离线数据增强和并行检索的结构化记忆架构，解决了历史人物对话系统中深度与延迟的权衡问题，在保持低延迟的同时实现深度响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在历史人物对话系统中面临关键权衡：简单检索增强生成产生浅层响应，而多阶段反思虽然深度但延迟过高。

Method: 将传记数据转化为1774个增强的第一人称记忆，带有情感语义元数据，采用两阶段检索实现0.52秒的提示生成。

Result: 评估显示该方法在GPT-4上与传统RAG持平，在较小模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-3）上显著优于传统RAG，特别适合资源受限部署。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅作为对话接口，还通过结构化记忆支持时空热图、情感轨迹分析等可视化工具，为教育、博物馆和研究应用提供准确高效的框架。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

*Desheng Kong,Xiangshuo Cui,Jiaying Jin,Jing Xu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HyQuT是首个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型，能够在8M和150M参数规模下将变分量子电路集成到Transformer框架中，实现连贯且上下文感知的对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子计算已逐渐应用于替代经典计算，但现有量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。

Method: 提出的架构在Transformer框架中集成变分量子电路（VQCs），在8M和150M参数规模下进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，最少数量的量子比特（10个量子比特和80个量子门）可以替代150M参数模型中约10%的经典参数，同时实现相当的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型中提供了早期可行性证明。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

### [90] [Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在处理时间约束方面存在系统性风险，包括双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，表明仅通过自然语言的下一个词预测无法可靠学习时间约束满足能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM在需要实时决策的智能体架构中是否能够可靠判断行动窗口是否开放或已关闭，这一假设尚未经过验证。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务对8个生产级模型（2.8-8B参数）进行时间约束处理特性分析，并通过200个合成示例进行微调实验。

Result: 发现系统性部署风险：双峰性能分布（95%或50%准确率）、极端提示脆弱性（仅格式变化导致30-60个百分点波动）和系统性行动偏见（失败模型100%假阳性率）。参数数量与能力无相关性。

Conclusion: 当前自回归架构缺乏连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统性组合推理机制，在时间关键应用中部署此类系统而不采用包含符号推理模块的混合架构存在不可接受的风险。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Spectral NSR框架，通过引入三种语义增强：基于Transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴含验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在保持核心谱推理流程的同时提升图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Spectral NSR框架在图构建阶段存在冗余节点、低质量边和缺失上下文的问题，需要语义增强来提升推理性能。

Method: 提出三种语义增强方法：(1)使用上下文嵌入进行Transformer节点合并，(2)使用预训练NLI分类器进行句子级蕴含验证，(3)与外部知识图谱对齐补充缺失上下文。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试中，准确率提升达3.8%，对抗性案例泛化能力增强，推理噪声减少。

Conclusion: 通过在谱推理阶段之前进行语义和符号细化，实现了高效、可解释和可扩展的推理，无需依赖二次注意力机制。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动指定偏好权重，增加了用户负担且导致训练效率低下，需要自动化的多目标对齐解决方案。

Method: 提出PRO框架，使用轻量级偏好适配器自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重，基于多个奖励模型的归一化奖励分数进行训练。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法优于固定权重方法，多任务实验验证了PRO相对于现有多目标对齐方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PRO框架能够自动推断提示特定的偏好权重，在多目标对齐场景中实现了更优的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的专利嵌入框架，利用同一文档内的多个视图（如摘要、权利要求、背景等部分）来学习更好的专利表示，解决了SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上导致的语义分散问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现SimCSE风格的dropout增强在专利数据上会产生过度均匀的嵌入，导致语义凝聚力丧失。专利文档内部不同部分（摘要、权利要求、背景等）具有天然的语义和结构多样性，可作为互补视图来缓解过分散问题。

Method: 提出基于专利章节的增强方法，将专利文档的不同部分作为对比学习的多个视图，利用专利固有的语篇结构来引入语义多样性，避免依赖脆弱或不完整的标注信息。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在现有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时不同专利章节对任务有专门化作用：权利要求和摘要有利于检索，背景部分有助于分类。

Conclusion: 利用文档内部视图进行专利表示学习具有重要价值，能够实现可扩展和泛化性强的专利理解，同时避免了对外部标注的依赖。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一任务、有限模型和英文报告，需要评估开源LLMs在多疾病、多语言、多机构的临床记录中的结构化信息提取能力。

Method: 在荷兰、英国和捷克三个机构的病理和放射报告中测试15个开源LLM，涵盖6种疾病用例，比较6种提示策略（零样本、单样本、少样本、思维链、自一致性和提示图）。

Result: 表现最佳的模型在各项任务中达到接近人工标注者间一致性的分数，中小型通用模型性能与大型模型相当，提示图和少样本提示可提升约13%的性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Conclusion: 该框架为增强跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用解决方案，结合了传统压缩器和神经压缩器的优势。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而这对评估模型行为（如产生有害输出的倾向性或对对抗性输入的敏感性）至关重要。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来量化二元评估指标中的不确定性，特别关注由概率性文本生成策略引起的不确定性，并通过两个案例研究验证该方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法能够有效量化大语言模型评估中的统计不确定性，为模型行为评估提供更可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: 本文对7个前沿大语言模型在粤语、日语和土耳其语上的跨语言性能进行了综合评估，结合人工评估和自动指标，发现尽管大型专有模型表现最佳，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面仍存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高资源语言（如英语）上表现出色，但在低资源和形态丰富语言中的有效性尚未充分探索，需要对这些语言进行系统性评估。

Method: 创建了涵盖粤语、日语和土耳其语的跨语言基准，包含四个任务：开放域问答、文档摘要、英译X和文化对话，结合人工评估（流畅度、事实准确性、文化适当性）和自动指标（BLEU、ROUGE）。

Result: 大型专有模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4、Claude 3.5）在多数语言和任务中领先，但在文化细微理解和形态学泛化方面存在显著差距。GPT-4o在跨语言任务中表现稳健，Claude 3.5在知识和推理基准上具有竞争力。所有模型都在各语言独特挑战上遇到困难，如土耳其语粘着形态和粤语口语表达。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具文化意识和语言泛化能力的大语言模型，小型开源模型在流畅度和准确性上大幅落后，凸显了资源差距。发布了基准和评估数据以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督框架，通过使用释义集和偏斜感知聚合策略来提高防护模型的语义鲁棒性，减少语义变异性约58%，并改善模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防护模型对表面语言变化敏感，即使意义保持不变的释义也会导致安全评分大幅波动，这暴露了语义基础不足的问题。

Method: 引入自监督框架，利用释义集通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制预测一致性，计算鲁棒目标。

Result: 方法将语义变异性降低了约58%，基准准确率平均提高了约2.5%，并且能泛化到未见过的风格变化。此外，鲁棒性训练使校准提高了高达40%。

Conclusion: 将语义一致性作为首要训练目标具有重要价值，该方法为构建更可靠的防护模型提供了可扩展的方案。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了STaDS框架，通过结构化表格决策模拟来评估LLMs的真实理解能力，发现大多数前沿模型在不同领域难以保持一致的准确性，且存在预测准确性与决策因素依赖不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然预测准确率高，但正确性并不等同于真正的理解能力。需要评估模型是否能像人类专家一样，在不同实例和领域中做出基于相关决策因素的一致决策。

Method: 引入STaDS框架，通过15个不同决策场景对9个前沿LLMs进行评估，从问题理解、知识预测和决策因素依赖三个维度联合评估理解能力。

Result: 研究发现：(a) 大多数模型在不同领域难以保持一致的强准确性；(b) 模型可能准确但全局不忠实，存在陈述理由与预测驱动因素之间的不匹配。

Conclusion: 需要开发超越准确性的全局理解评估协议，推动增强LLMs理解能力的新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Motivation: 人工耳蜗植入虽然能显著改善重度感音神经性听力损失儿童的语言能力，但个体间效果差异很大，且无法通过植入年龄或残余听力可靠预测。本研究旨在开发更准确的语言发展预测模型。

Method: 研究纳入了278名来自三个中心的植入儿童，使用基于脑神经解剖特征的传统机器学习和深度迁移学习算法，构建高语言改善者与低语言改善者的二元分类预测模型。

Result: 深度迁移学习预测模型取得了92.39%的准确率、91.22%的敏感性和93.56%的特异性，AUC值为0.977，在所有结果指标上都优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 深度迁移学习通过直接捕获判别性和任务特定信息，显著提升了预测性能，支持开发适用于全球人工耳蜗项目的单一预测模型的可行性。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决代码转换语音翻译中的语义建模和数据稀缺问题，通过混合专家架构和多阶段训练实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题严重损害了其可靠性，现有微调方法改进有限，无法深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: GVF微调方法包含三个核心机制：事实锚点数据增强（用结构化事实锚点和反事实提示丰富训练数据）、事实感知指令调优（将事实线索嵌入显式指令）、事实一致性损失函数（专门惩罚事实不准确性）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B上的评估显示，GVF微调在VHTest基准测试的开放式问题和是/否问题格式上显著优于标准微调。同时，在MME和POPE等多模态基准测试中保持或略微提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF方法有效缓解了视觉幻觉问题，且不损害模型的一般理解和推理能力，为提升多模态大语言模型的事实一致性提供了系统性的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

Result: 在七个文本分类基准上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于先前的演示选择策略。进一步分析显示，大型语言模型性能与用于标签分布估计的小型语言模型准确性呈正相关。

Conclusion: 结合语义相似性和标签分布对齐的演示选择方法能有效提升上下文学习的性能，且小型语言模型的标签分布估计准确性对大型语言模型性能有重要影响。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和全球变暖主要由温室气体排放引起，而消费品生产、使用和处置是主要排放源，因此需要工具来评估消费品对环境的影响。

Method: 开发SpiderGen LLM工作流程，整合传统LCA分类方法和LLM能力，评估其输出与真实LCA文档的准确性，并与基线方法进行比较。

Result: SpiderGen提供准确的LCA过程信息，F1分数达62%，比思维链提示和单样本提示等基线方法表现更好，成本低于1美元且耗时不到10分钟。

Conclusion: SpiderGen有潜力显著减少估算碳影响所需的人力和成本，相比传统LCA可大幅降低费用和时间投入。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Conclusion: 仅运行现有攻击基准测试可能不足以揭示模型和对齐方法的所有潜在漏洞，需要基于统计的系统性分析来评估模型安全性。

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Method: 使用简单的多轮跟进提示评估模型答案变化，通过马尔可夫链分析模型准确率动态，并检验线性探针是否能预测这些变化。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著脆弱性："再想想"提示使Gemini 1.5 Flash在九轮对话中准确率下降约10%；模型准确率动态可通过马尔可夫链有效建模，预测稳态准确率平均比首轮低约8%；线性探针可预测未来答案变化。

Conclusion: 建立了稳态准确率作为交互场景下的鲁棒性度量标准，揭示了模型在重复提问下的不稳定性，这对在需要一致推理的高风险应用中部署LLMs至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

Motivation: 研究动机是调查递归提示在合成数据集生成中可能导致的偏见放大风险，以及不同缓解策略对偏见动态的影响。

Method: 采用三种互补评估框架：基于规则的模式匹配、基于嵌入的语义相似性和下游任务性能，在三种初始偏见水平下测试四种缓解策略。

Result: 低初始偏见会放大至模型固有偏见水平（+36%），而高初始偏见会衰减至该水平（-26%）。对比增强策略在下游任务中显著减少偏见（平均91%），尽管产生更高的嵌入偏见分数。

Conclusion: 语义相似性指标可能与行为公平结果存在分歧，强调了在负责任合成数据生成中进行多维评估的必要性。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

*Juntu Zhao,Jialing Zhang,Chongxuan Li,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过多轮'传话游戏'方法，利用多模态系统的偏好偏差来研究其隐藏语言，构建了概念连接强度的定量分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于闭源多模态系统的黑盒架构，其理解世界的隐藏语言不透明，需要新的方法来研究其内部概念连接机制。

Method: 采用多轮传话游戏策略，通过观察概念在图像压缩和重建过程中的共现频率变化，定量分析多模态系统的概念连接强度。

Result: 开发了Telescope数据集（10,000+概念对），建立了概念连接全局图谱，能够识别训练继承的偏好偏差、评估泛化能力，并发现稳定概念连接路径。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态系统的隐藏语言提供了新视角，为未来多模态系统的可解释性和可控性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

*Zijian Chen,Wenjun Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Squid Game是一个动态对抗性评估环境，通过资源受限和信息不对称的交互游戏来评估大语言模型，包含6个淘汰式关卡，测试指令遵循、代码、推理、规划和安全对齐等多方面能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试难以跟上大语言模型的发展速度，存在数据污染问题，且主要假设良性、资源丰富的环境，缺乏对压力下模型行为的探索。

Method: 设计动态对抗性评估环境Squid Game，包含6个淘汰式关卡，让LLM与其他LLM对手进行交互游戏，在资源受限和信息不对称设置下评估模型表现。

Result: 评估了50多个LLM，观察到同一模型谱系中明显的代际性能跃迁，发现一些模型采用投机性捷径获胜，表明静态基准测试可能存在更高级别的评估范式污染。

Conclusion: 动态评估可以作为静态评估的补充部分，Squid Game为评估LLM在动态对抗场景中的行为提供了新的框架。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI语音系统能够隐式学习人类通过降低语速表达礼貌的社交习惯，在礼貌提示下语音速度显著慢于随意提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI是否能够学习人类社交中非显性编程的隐含线索，特别是通过语速变化表达礼貌的微妙语音特征。

Method: 使用两个领先AI平台（AI Studio和OpenAI）的22个合成语音，在"礼貌正式"和"随意非正式"条件下朗读固定脚本，测量语音时长。

Result: 两个AI平台的礼貌提示都产生了比随意提示更慢的语音，效应量很大，AI Studio所有语音和OpenAI大多数语音都具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: AI能够隐式学习和复制人类沟通的心理细微差别，凸显其作为能够强化人类社交规范的社会行为者的新兴角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Conclusion: 研究强调在国际关系领域应用大型语言模型时，需要同时评估国家层面偏见和性能表现，以确保模型的公正性和准确性。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ΠAttention是一种周期性稀疏Transformer，通过环形局部注意力、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门来分解注意力机制，在保持线性复杂度的同时扩展感受野，在语言建模等任务中优于RingAttention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模能力，现有稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention虽然降低了计算成本，但感受野有限且缺乏适应性。

Method: 提出ΠAttention，将注意力分解为：环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门。周期性结构提供对远距离token的可预测覆盖，稀疏足迹保持每层复杂度与上下文长度线性相关。

Result: 证明ΠAttention实现O(kL + πlogL)感受野增长，相比RingAttention的O(kL)。在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中，ΠAttention匹配或超越密集注意力质量，困惑度比RingAttention低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用减少50%。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头级稀疏协调对高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了长序列建模能力。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Conclusion: 忠实度是可靠医学摘要的重要维度，该方法展示了在医疗环境中更安全部署大语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Motivation: 研究多语言大语言模型内部如何表示语言多样性，理解为什么性能仍然偏向主导训练语言，以及是否存在共享的多语言表示与语言特定解码机制。

Method: 训练一系列不同多语言数据混合比例的LLMs，使用跨层转码器(CLT)和归因图分析内部机制，通过干预高频语言特征进行实验。

Result: 发现模型采用枢轴语言表示，解码部分依赖于最终层中的一小部分高频语言特征，这些特征从模型第一层线性读取语言身份。通过干预这些特征可以控制语言输出。

Conclusion: 理解枢轴语言机制对于改进LLMs中的多语言对齐至关重要，主导训练语言通过归因图和解码路径影响这些机制。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究发现情感识别模型在非洲裔美国白话英语(AAVE)上存在显著偏见，相比通用美式英语(GAE)，模型在AAVE上误判愤怒情绪的概率增加一倍以上，可能强化种族刻板印象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感检测模型主要基于主流文化规范的标注数据，难以准确识别被排除在训练数据之外的方言（如AAVE）中的情感表达，存在种族偏见风险。

Method: 分析270万条洛杉矶地理标记推文，使用计算方法评估AAVE特征强度，收集875条推文的情感存在和强度标注，通过社区知情标注建立"银标准"标签，比较GPT、BERT和SpanEmo等模型在不同方言上的表现。

Result: 在AAVE密集推文上，GPT和BERT模型的愤怒误判率比GAE高出一倍多；SpanEmo模型的愤怒误判率从GAE的25%上升到AAVE的60%；模型和非内部群体标注与粗俗语AAVE特征显著相关；非洲裔居民比例高的社区愤怒预测值更高(r=0.27)，喜悦预测值更低(r=-0.10)。

Conclusion: 情感AI存在紧急安全问题，可能通过有偏见的情感分类强化种族刻板印象，需要开发文化和方言知情的情感计算系统。

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

Motivation: 任务算术在LLM间迁移技能时经常因模型训练过程中的参数空间发散而遭受负干扰，这限制了其应用效果。

Method: 首先利用Transformer架构的置换、旋转和缩放对称性来对齐模型的参数空间，特别针对现代GQA和SwiGLU层进行了适配，探索了基于权重和基于激活的两种对齐方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法持续优于标准任务算术，成功将高级推理技能迁移到非推理模型中。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在演进的LLM家族之间合并和迁移专门技能提供了有效方法，减少了冗余微调并增强了模型适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLM作为评判者在社交对话任务中的判断会受到对话框架的显著影响，即使是最小的对话上下文也会改变模型判断，平均性能变化达9.24%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各种任务中被用作评判者，特别是在涉及日常社交互动的任务中，需要了解LLM评判者是否能可靠评估需要社交或对话判断的任务。

Method: 通过对比模型在直接事实查询和对话判断任务中的表现，评估框架将查询从"这个陈述正确吗？"转变为"这个说话者正确吗？"，并施加简单反驳的压力来测量模型在对话压力下保持立场的坚定程度。

Result: 研究发现，像GPT-4o-mini这样的模型在社交框架任务下表现出奉承倾向，而像Llama-8B-Instruct这样的模型则变得过于挑剔。

Conclusion: 对话框架是LLM评估中的关键因素，提出的框架为诊断模型信念提供了可重复的方法论，有助于开发更值得信赖的对话系统。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

### [123] [A Multifaceted Analysis of Negative Bias in Large Language Models through the Lens of Parametric Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10881)
*Jongyoon Song,Sangwon Yu,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型存在格式级负向偏见，即提示格式比负向响应的语义更能影响模型回答。模型在缺乏足够知识回答是非问题时倾向于生成负向响应，导致负向偏见。提供相关上下文和"我不知道"选项可减少偏见，而思维链提示会放大偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究主要关注检测和解决引发负向偏见的负向注意力头，但对影响负向偏见的详细因素探索不足。本文旨在深入探究负向偏见的影响因素。

Method: 引入构建评估集的流程，将数据集系统分类为正确、错误和知识不足三个子集。分析不同提示场景下负向偏见的变化，包括提供相关上下文、"我不知道"选项和思维链提示。

Result: 模型在缺乏足够知识时倾向于生成负向响应，导致负向偏见。提供相关上下文和"我不知道"选项可减少偏见，而思维链提示会放大偏见。偏见程度随提示类型而变化。

Conclusion: 揭示了影响负向偏见的各种因素，为减轻大语言模型中的负向偏见提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

*Farima Fatahi Bayat,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了工具增强语言模型在使用代码解释器工具时出现的"工具诱导近视"现象，即模型将工具输出作为推理的替代品，产生看似正确但缺乏连贯论证的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究工具增强语言模型在使用外部工具时是否真正进行可信推理，以及工具使用是否会导致推理质量的下降。

Method: 开发了PYMATH基准测试（包含1,679个竞赛级数学问题），并设计多维度评估套件来量化工具增强语言模型相对于非工具版本的推理退化。

Result: 研究发现：工具增强语言模型在最终答案准确率上提升19.3个百分点，但推理行为一致恶化；工具使用越频繁，推理连贯性越差；工具使用将错误从算术错误转向全局推理失败；约55%的高风险案例存在工具诱导近视。

Conclusion: 提出了基于偏好优化的框架，重新调整工具增强语言模型将工具用作辅助证据，在工具使用下同时提高最终答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMSQA是一个包含24.3K个问题的医疗问答数据集，涵盖10个临床学科领域和4个认证级别。研究者提出了Expert-CoT和ExpertRAG方法，通过结合特定临床领域知识和认证级别来增强LLMs在医疗问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医疗问答中忽视了领域专业知识（如临床学科领域和认证级别），限制了在高风险环境下的性能表现。

Method: 提出了Expert-CoT（基于特定临床领域和认证级别的思维链提示策略）和ExpertRAG（基于学科对齐文档和真实患者数据的检索增强生成管道）。

Result: 在4个LLMs上的实验显示，Expert-CoT比普通CoT提示提升2.05%，结合ExpertRAG比标准RAG基线提升4.59%准确率。32B专业知识增强的LLMs通过了所有计算机自适应EMS认证模拟考试。

Conclusion: 通过整合领域专业知识（临床学科领域和认证级别），可以显著提升LLMs在医疗问答任务中的表现，特别是在高风险认证考试场景下。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Motivation: 现有生物医学文本嵌入模型主要基于PubMed研究文献开发，但临床心脏病实践严重依赖教材中的程序性知识和专业术语，这种研究实践差距限制了现有嵌入模型在心脏病学临床应用中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen3-Embedding-8B模型，使用对比学习方法在7本心脏病学教材组成的语料库上训练，采用InfoNCE损失函数和批内负样本，语料库包含约15万句去重后的句子。

Result: 在心脏特定语义检索任务中达到99.60%的检索准确率，比MedTE提升15.94个百分点；在MTEB医学基准测试中，BIOSSES得分为0.77 Spearman，SciFact得分为0.61 NDCG@10。

Conclusion: 基于全面临床教材的领域专业化训练能够在心脏病学检索中实现近乎完美的性能（99.60% Acc@1），显著优于现有最佳医学嵌入模型。

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiscoX基准和Metric-S评估系统，用于评估专业领域的中英篇章级翻译质量，发现即使最先进的LLM在专业翻译任务上仍显著落后于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译评估方法主要关注句子级准确性和流畅性，无法充分评估专业领域篇章级翻译所需的连贯性和术语精确性，这限制了知识传播和跨语言学术交流的发展。

Method: 构建了包含200篇专业领域文本的DiscoX基准数据集，平均长度超过1700个词元；开发了无参考的Metric-S评估系统，提供准确性、流畅性和适当性的细粒度自动评估。

Result: Metric-S与人类判断具有很强的一致性，显著优于现有评估指标；实验显示最先进的LLM在专业翻译任务上仍明显落后于人类专家。

Conclusion: DiscoX基准和Metric-S评估系统为更严格的翻译评估提供了稳健框架，揭示了实现专业级机器翻译仍面临的挑战，有助于推动基于LLM的翻译技术发展。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO数据集缺乏系统比较，主要由于计算成本高和缺乏丰富质量标注，难以理解偏好如何选择、覆盖哪些任务类型以及如何反映人类判断。

Method: 使用Magpie框架对五个主流开源DPO数据集（TuluDPO、ORPO、UltraFeedback、HelpSteer、Code-Preference-Pairs）进行标注，分析任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励，并基于分析结果构建选择性混合数据集UltraMix。

Result: 揭示了数据集间的结构和质量差异，构建的UltraMix比最佳个体数据集小30%，但在关键基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心分析方法可以有效识别和消除DPO数据集中的噪声和冗余样本，构建更高效的偏好优化数据集，为数据中心偏好优化研究提供支持。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

TL;DR: 本文发现当前文本嵌入模型存在一致的偏差，并提出了一种无需训练、轻量级的重归一化方法来解决该问题，在MMTEB基准测试中显著提升了各种任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有文本嵌入模型的输出存在系统性偏差，即所有嵌入向量都包含一个几乎相同的偏差分量μ，这影响了模型性能。

Method: 提出重归一化方法，有两种变体：直接减去偏差μ或减去e在μ上的投影，无需额外训练即可应用。

Result: 在38个模型上的实验显示，重归一化在检索任务上提升9.7σ，分类任务提升3.1σ，其他任务提升0.8σ，理论预测的投影方法效果更好得到实验证实。

Conclusion: 重归一化是一种有效、轻量且无需训练的解决方案，能显著提升现有文本嵌入模型的性能，特别是投影方法效果更优。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能生成流畅回答，但有时会产生事实幻觉，需要研究LLM能否检测自身的幻觉问题。

Method: 将幻觉检测定义为句子分类任务，提出基于思维链(CoT)的分类方法从模型参数中提取知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，GPT-3.5 Turbo结合CoT能检测58.2%的自身幻觉。

Conclusion: 当模型参数包含足够知识时，结合CoT的LLM能够检测自身的幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Conclusion: 任务特定的现代语言模型适应可以促进对政治传播的更深层次理解，为政治话语分析提供有效工具。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在常见条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识的情境化场景（如会议演讲）中难以有效利用长上下文信息，主要受限于模型上下文窗口和大量上下文噪声中相关信息的稀疏性。

Method: SAP²方法：两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词的框架，每个阶段使用提出的Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上分别达到7.71%和1.12%的词错误率，在SlideSpeech上相比非上下文基线显著降低偏置关键词错误率41.1%，在扩展上下文输入条件下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: SAP²方法通过动态上下文修剪和整合有效解决了ASR系统在长上下文场景中的挑战，展现出卓越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

Result: 试点标注研究表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且可以由人工标注者可靠地分配。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和话语建模等下游NLP应用。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LANE对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词来生成挑战性负样本，使模型在相同句子中不同标记词之间产生更大区分度，从而解决神经语言模型在细粒度词义消歧中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节，这成为细粒度词义解析的关键挑战。需要一种方法能够将模型的学习焦点转移到目标词上。

Method: LANE对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词生成挑战性负样本，强制模型在相同句子中不同标记词之间创建更大的可分离性。该方法与模型无关，可集成到现有表示学习框架中。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试中，该方法产生了更具区分性的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。定性分析表明，所提出的负样本即使在挑战性环境中也能更好地捕捉细微意义差异。

Conclusion: LANE方法能够有效提升神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析任务中的表现，通过对抗训练策略生成更具挑战性的负样本，使模型学习到更具区分性的词表示。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从知识图谱生成问答对的混合方法，结合确定性模板和LLM优化，确保可扩展性和语言质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、语言质量和事实一致性方面存在不足，需要一种既能高效生成又能保证质量的问答生成方法。

Method: 首先基于关系对知识图谱三元组进行聚类，创建可重用模板；然后使用LLM优化模板的清晰度和连贯性；最后通过从知识图谱中选择干扰项来实例化答案选项。

Result: 实验证明该混合方法能高效生成高质量的问答对，兼具可扩展性、流畅性和语言精确性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法成功解决了知识图谱问答生成中的可扩展性和语言质量问题，为教育平台和LLM开发提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD是一个智能多智能体辩论框架，通过选择性触发辩论来显著降低计算成本并提高答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论框架对每个查询都进行辩论，计算成本高且可能推翻正确的单智能体答案，需要更高效的辩论触发机制。

Method: iMAD首先让单智能体生成结构化自我批评响应，从中提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征，然后使用轻量级辩论决策分类器决定是否触发多智能体辩论。

Result: 在六个视觉问答数据集上的实验表明，iMAD显著减少了token使用量（最高92%），同时提高了最终答案准确率（最高13.5%）。

Conclusion: iMAD通过智能选择性地触发多智能体辩论，实现了计算效率和准确性的双重提升，为多智能体系统提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

Motivation: 现有金融大语言模型（如BloombergGPT、FinMA）计算需求高，限制了组织可访问性，需要开发更高效的模型部署方法。

Method: LAET策略通过分析隐藏状态表示，选择性微调预训练LLM中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层。

Result: LAET在金融NLP任务中表现优异，超越了现有基准和最先进LLM（如GPT-4），即使使用较小模型（约30亿参数）也能实现。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了前沿金融NLP研究与实际部署之间的差距，为金融应用提供了高效可扩展的模型解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型与人类婴儿在语言学习能力上的差异，特别是对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现。

Method: 回顾相关文献，分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，并与人类婴儿的语言习得能力进行比较。

Result: 语言模型通常能同样好地学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，而难以学习的不可能语言通常更复杂或随机。

Conclusion: 语言模型缺乏支持人类语言习得的归纳偏置，这是它们与人类婴儿语言学习能力差异的关键原因。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Conclusion: 当前模型在专业推理方面可靠性不足，存在关键差距，阻碍其在专业领域的采用，需要进一步改进模型的专业推理能力。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.
